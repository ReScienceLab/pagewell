# Skill: Generate Tools Hub

## Purpose

Generate or update a `/tools` hub that lists all durable free tools on the site.

The tools hub improves internal linking, helps users discover related utilities, and gives search engines a stable index of utility pages.

## Required inputs

- `SITE_PROFILE.md`
- `DESIGN.md`
- list of existing or planned free tool pages
- product/company facts

## Framework-neutral page spec

```yaml
route: /tools
pageType: tools-hub
title: Free <Category> Tools | <Brand>
description: A collection of free tools for <ICP/use case>. No signup required.
h1: Free <category> tools
noindex: false
sections:
  - hero
  - tool-grid
  - categories-or-filters
  - product-cta
  - faq
schema:
  - CollectionPage
  - BreadcrumbList
  - FAQPage
```

## Required structure

1. Hero explaining who the tools are for.
2. Tool cards with name, description, category, and link.
3. Category filters if there are 10+ tools or multiple product areas.
4. CTA to main product/company.

## Implementation rules

- Exclude private/noindex tools.

## Acceptance criteria
